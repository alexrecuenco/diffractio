# Todo

## Bugs
* utils_math has several normalize functions




## alpha
* Check that RS is working properly of XYZ (multiprocessing)
* * XZ and  XYZ: function for interactive drawing I(x,y;z)

Algorithms:
* Implement PWD
* Implement WPM
* Implement VPM
* Implement new BPM
* Implemement VRS - working in development


Masks:
  * XYZ m√°sk - develop more masks
